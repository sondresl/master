# Commutativity Analysis in ABS

This is the source code for my master's thesis project. 

## Building and Running

Build the project with

    stack build

To run the project, input must be sent to stdin, and be JSON as generated by an ABSTOOLS compiler
that supports printing the syntax tree as JSON. An example run:

    stack run < json/BoolSimple.json

The output will be printed to the terminal.

To run the program, you must have [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/wiki) installed.
